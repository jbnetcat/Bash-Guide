## Introduction
BASH is a shell, which is a *command interpreter,* based on its predecessor, the *Bourne* shell. The acronym **BASH** stands for: *Bourne Again Shell.* This environment allows you to interact with your OS via commands, and runs inside your terminal normally, but you can also run a Bash/Shell script as a standalone executable. This guide covers some very useful Bash commands for WhiteHatters. 

You could always fire up a terminal and ask:
	<pre>$ whatis bash <br>bash (1)    - GNU Bourne-Again SHell</pre>
Or

<pre>$ whereis bash
bash: /bin/bash /etc/bash.bashrc /usr/share/man/man1/bash.1.gz</pre>
